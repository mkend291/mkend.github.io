PUBLISHED,Across the Valley,[Wind Ensemble],Wind Ensemble,"Inspired by a drive along Colorado’s Million Dollar Highway (US 550), “Across the Valley” captures the feeling of winding through the mountains and coming upon the town of Ouray, nestled quietly between the ridges of the Rockies.  The landscape felt both vast and intimate, which sparked the idea for this piece.
To portray a valley between two ridges, the music follows the structure of the sonata form. The exposition begins with a falling motif, descending into the valley. The development reflects the night spent there, looking up at a sky free of light pollution. The recapitulation returns the opening material as we depart the valley, bringing the development’s motif along as a “souvenir”. Throughout the piece, call-and-response and canonic gestures suggest the echoes and reverberations that linger between the mountains.",6,10/30/25,2025,https://youtu.be/8SblEsUZEHY,,3,,,[Original]

PUBLISHED,A Christmas Sonata,[Orchestra],Orchestra,"“A Christmas Sonata” is a festive piece for orchestra that arose from the question: “what if Mozart was a film composer?” The piece uses Mozart’s Sonata No. 16 mvt. 1 (Sonata Facile) as the theme for a hypothetical Christmas movie (like Home Alone). The first section of the piece loosely follows the original sonata’s exposition. The development strays further, exploring different keys and introducing a tender setting for the tune. Finally, the initial material returns in the recapitulation and accelerates to a dramatic finale. To add to the “Christmas flair”, some snippets of Jingle Bells have been cheekily inserted in the second half of the piece.

This was later changed to ""tipsy,"" which described the uneven dance-like feel of certain parts. Ultimately, the title ""chameleon"" was chosen, capturing the colorful and comical nature of the piece, although the name's ambiguity remains.",5,2/2/21,2021,,,1,,,[Original]
